Aptitude Assignment 3

1) Write two quadratic equations such that the sum of roots equals twice the
product of roots?
Ans:- Equation 1:
Let's assume the quadratic equation is of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
The sum of roots is given by -b/a, and the product of roots is given by c/a.
To satisfy the condition, we need: -b/a = 2 * (c/a)
Simplifying, we get -b = 2c
Therefore, one quadratic equation that satisfies the condition is:
x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0................1) 1st equation

Equation 2:
Let's assume the quadratic equation is of the form dx^2 + ex + f = 0.
The sum of roots is given by -e/d, and the product of roots is given by f/d.
To satisfy the condition, we need: -e/d = 2 * (f/d)
Simplifying, we get -e = 2f
Therefore, another quadratic equation that satisfies the condition is:
2x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0................1) 2nd equation

2)  2x+3y=12 has (2,3) as its solution or not?
Ans:- (2, 3) is not a solution to the equation 2x + 3y = 12

3. Find possible coordinates of (x,y) such that point (1,1), (2,2) & (x,y) are collinear?
 Ans:- The possible coordinates are of the form (n, n), where n is any real number. Examples include (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (-1, -1), (-2, -2), and so on.

4) Find out all possible values of a & b for which the ratio of a^3+b^3 to a^3-b^3 is 1:1 a,b are real numbers.
Ans:-Any value of "a" can be chosen, and "b" must be equal to 0.

5. The triangle area formed by the lines y=x, y-axis and y=3 line will be?
Ans:-The area of the triangle formed by the lines y = x, y-axis, and y = 3 is 4.5 square units.
